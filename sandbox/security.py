Sandbox security (Section V.2 points 3, 4).

Four things the sandbox has to hold up under `tests/test_sandbox_security.py`:
  1. import allowlist    -- only whitelisted modules can be imported
  2. path allowlist       -- file access restricted to allowed_directories
  3. timeout               -- enforced by killing the worker process (executor.py)
  4. memory limit          -- resource.setrlimit, applied here, called once when
                              the worker process starts (executor.py)

Only the standard library is used here (no third-party sandboxing libs).

    CPython process can already be sitting close to a tight cap, and that

    anything is actually leaking or wrong, just because the cap meant for
    the sandboxed code was still in effect for the worker's own plumbing.
