"""
Sandbox security (Section V.2 points 3, 4).

Five things the sandbox has to hold up under `tests/test_sandbox_security.py`:
  1. import allowlist    -- only whitelisted modules can be imported
  2. path allowlist       -- file access restricted to allowed_directories
  3. network block         -- socket.socket() patched to raise (block_network())
  4. timeout               -- enforced by killing the worker process (executor.py)
  5. memory limit          -- resource.setrlimit, applied here, called once when
                              the worker process starts (executor.py)

Before this, network access was only blocked as a side effect of
authorized_imports never including socket or any HTTP client module -- true
today, but not a dedicated guarantee: if a networking module is ever
added to the allowlist for a legitimate reason, access would silently
reopen with no separate safety net. block_network() patches the actual
primitive underneath nearly all Python networking (socket.socket) so
construction raises no matter how code got a reference to it.

Only the standard library is used here (no third-party sandboxing libs).
