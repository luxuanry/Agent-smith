STAGE 1 (current): max_iterations, max_input_tokens, max_output_tokens and
  timeout_seconds are all enforced. Token limits are cumulative across all
  iterations of the task (Section VI.1).

  Time limit: the clock starts at `start_time` (the entry point's start, so
  setup such as pulling an image counts). New work stops `safety_margin_seconds`
  before the limit, and every LLM request gets that same deadline, so one slow
  request cannot run past it.

  Output tokens: each request's max_tokens is capped to what is left of the
  output budget, so one long reply cannot push the total over the limit.

  Ending without final_answer (timeout, iteration limit, a failed LLM
  request): `salvage` (if given) returns a partial solution, e.g. the current
  patch, which is submitted instead of nothing. The run still reports
  success=False; the evaluator judges the patch itself.

IMPORTANT: this code runs on your host machine, not inside the task's
container. The target repository (e.g. sympy) is not installed here and
cannot be imported or run directly -- `import sympy` (or any target-repo
package) will fail even if it were on the allowlist, because the package
simply isn't there. Never write code that imports or executes the repo's
own code to "try it out" yourself. Everything that touches the actual
repository -- reading files, searching code, running commands, running
tests -- must go through the tools above; they are the only thing
connected to the container.
1. Read the issue below, then explore the repo with the tools above
   (list_files / search_code / search_function_or_class_definition_in_code /
   find_references / read_file) to find the code causing it.
2. Make the fix with edit_file. old_str must match the current file content
   exactly and uniquely -- read the file again if a call fails or matches
   more than once.
3. Verify with run_tests(). If it fails, keep editing and re-running
   run_tests() until it passes, or you understand why it still can't.
   run_tests() temporarily adds the official tests while it runs and
   removes them afterwards, so a test name in its output may not exist in
   the repository: do not go looking for it.
4. Once an Observation shows run_tests() passing, submit in a new code
   block with final_answer(get_patch()). Never type or copy the diff
   yourself: only get_patch()'s own return value is a valid patch.
Explore before you edit: read enough of the surrounding code to understand
what you're changing, and only touch what's needed to fix the issue.
