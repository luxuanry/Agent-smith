"""
Docker container lifecycle management (Section V.4).

Pulled out of agent_swebench/__main__.py so it can be reused: agent_swebench
uses it to run real evaluation tasks, and if the sandbox CLI (`uv run
sandbox --mcp-stdio ...`) ever needs to spin up its own container for manual
debugging, it can just import this module instead of duplicating the
pull/start/cleanup logic.

The three functions map to the three stages of a container's life: pull the
image -> start the container -> clean it up when done. Everything calls the
docker CLI with argument lists (never a shell string), so each argument is
passed straight to execve -- no escaping to worry about, no shell-injection
risk.
